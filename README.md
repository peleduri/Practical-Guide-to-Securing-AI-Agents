# Practical Guide to Agentic AI Policies

A security engineer's playbook for defending **agentic AI coding assistants** — Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Codex, Cursor and peers — across developer laptops, remote/cloud development environments, and the new tier of GPU-first and sandbox-native compute providers.

It is organized as an **LLM Wiki** (following [Andrej Karpathy's pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)): a compounding, cross-referenced set of markdown pages that both humans and LLMs can read, extend, and maintain. Start at [`index.md`](index.md); the structure and conventions are described in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md); change history is in [`log.md`](log.md).

## The guide

1. **[Part 1 — The Risk Surface and Control Model](wiki/part-1-risk-surface-and-control-model.md)** — why an agent that *acts* is a different security problem than a chat window, the risk model, and the discovery + enforcement two-layer defense.
2. **[Part 2 — Endpoint Hardening and Policy Playbook](wiki/part-2-endpoint-hardening-and-policy-playbook.md)** — tool-call and MCP controls, data-aware rules, managed-settings baselines for Claude Code / Codex / Cursor, a real PreToolUse hook that guards GitHub Enterprise admin, and Claude Cowork controls.
3. **[Part 3 — Architecture, Gateways, and Remote Defense](wiki/part-3-architecture-gateways-and-remote-defense.md)** — the MCP broker model, IP allowlisting vs device trust, and defending remote/cloud development environments.
4. **[Part 4 — Beyond the Hyperscalers](wiki/part-4-beyond-the-hyperscalers.md)** — re-onboarding mature cloud security controls onto GPU-first neoclouds and sandbox-native providers, and the self-hosted-sandbox model as the control lever.
5. **[Part 5 — Personal, Always-On AI Assistants](wiki/part-5-personal-always-on-assistants.md)** — securing the OpenClaw / NanoClaw class: autonomous, messaging-connected, self-scheduling assistants that act without a prompt and answer to anyone who can message them.
6. **[Part 6 — The Agent Extension Supply Chain](wiki/part-6-extension-supply-chain.md)** — governing the skills, plugins, commands, hooks, and subagents you load into an agent as a reviewed software supply chain, not a convenience.
7. **[Part 7 — Agentic Workflow Platforms (n8n, Gemini Enterprise)](wiki/part-7-agentic-workflow-platforms.md)** — securing the automation and agent platforms wired into enterprise data: the SaaS-vs-self-hosted (and license-tier) decision, arbitrary-code and connector risk, the credential concentration, and shipping workflows as code (GitOps + AI security-review gate) with external secrets and the AI gateway for model calls.
8. **[Part 8 — Enterprise Work AI and the DSPM Prerequisite (Glean and peers)](wiki/part-8-work-ai-and-dspm.md)** — why a permission-aware Work AI platform is dangerous precisely because it faithfully mirrors overshared permissions, and why DSPM is the non-optional companion for knowing what sensitive data exists and who can reach it.
9. **[Part 9 — Detection, Monitoring, and Incident Response for Agents](wiki/part-9-detection-monitoring-ir.md)** — the operational other half of the guide: log the causal chain (not just the action), detect on agent behavioral IOCs, pre-build a fail-safe kill switch, do agent forensics, and use an AI-native SOC (governed by this same guide).
10. **[Part 10 — Agent Identity and Non-Human Identity (NHI)](wiki/part-10-agent-identity.md)** — the identity spine the guide leaned on: give each agent its own identity and delegate (don't impersonate), make access ephemeral / just-in-time / task-scoped with no standing privilege, validate intent against action, and govern the NHI lifecycle.

## Who it's for

Security engineers, platform / developer-experience teams, and CISOs standing up guardrails for AI coding agents.

## Notes

- Vendor and product names are **examples, not endorsements**. Agent controls change quickly — verify against the vendor docs cited on each page before relying on a specific setting.
- This is a general playbook; nothing here is specific to any one organization.
- Living document. See [`log.md`](log.md) for history.
