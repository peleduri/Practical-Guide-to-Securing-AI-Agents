## [2026-07-17] created | Initial LLM Wiki from the four-part guide

Imported the four-part "Practical Guide to Agentic AI Policies" as cross-referenced wiki pages under `wiki/`, and added `index.md` (catalog), `CLAUDE.md` (schema), and this log. Pages: Part 1 (risk surface and control model), Part 2 (endpoint hardening and policy playbook, including the GitHub Enterprise admin PreToolUse hook example and Claude Cowork controls), Part 3 (architecture, gateways, remote defense), Part 4 (GPU-first neoclouds and sandbox-native execution).

## [2026-07-17] add | Part 5 — Personal, Always-On AI Assistants (OpenClaw / NanoClaw class)

Added `wiki/part-5-personal-always-on-assistants.md` covering the personal always-on assistant class (OpenClaw, NanoClaw): autonomy at trigger time (heartbeat / no human prompt), messaging channels as both injection and exfil surface, consumer-virality shadow AI, the OpenClaw-vs-NanoClaw isolation/credential split, and the guard ecosystem (ClawGuard, ClawKeeper, openclaw-shield, NVIDIA NemoClaw) with a caution on judge-LLM gates. Updated `index.md` and `README.md`.

## [2026-07-17] add | Part 6 — The Agent Extension Supply Chain (Skills, Plugins, Commands, Hooks, Subagents)

Added `wiki/part-6-extension-supply-chain.md` treating the agent-extension layer (skills / plugins / commands / hooks / subagents) as a software supply chain: what each artifact is and why it is risky, evidence the marketplaces are already seeded with malicious skills (Snyk ToxicSkills and the ClawHavoc campaign), and a playbook (provenance + version pinning, administrator-managed hooks and permission rules, scanning instruction packs like code, inventorying the extension layer, least-privilege subagents, change control, brokering bundled MCP servers, and curating an internal pull-only registry such as Artifactory). Updated `index.md` and `README.md`.

## [2026-07-17] add | Part 7 — Agentic Workflow Platforms (n8n, Gemini Enterprise)

Added `wiki/part-7-agentic-workflow-platforms.md` covering platforms where agentic workflows are wired into enterprise data. n8n: arbitrary-code (Code node) and community-node supply-chain risk, webhook trigger surface, credential store + encryption key, and the Cloud-vs-Enterprise/self-hosted decision with the key insight that the security boundary is the license tier (SSO/SAML and SIEM log streaming are Enterprise-only), not cloud-vs-on-prem. Google Gemini Enterprise: connector over-reach, MCP tool-poisoning (GeminiJack zero-click exfil), and Google's controls (Agent Gateway, Model Armor, Agent Threat Detection, Agent Registry, VPC-SC/PSC, CMEK). Shared playbook: choose hosting by data sensitivity, kill arbitrary code, least-privilege connectors with exact identity mapping, authenticate triggers, protect the credential concentration, constrain egress, and stream agent actions to the SIEM. Also covers deploying workflows safely: ship them as code (IaC/GitOps) with an AI-powered security-review gate before publish, external secret management (Vault / cloud secret managers, never inline), and routing all workflow LLM calls through the AI gateway. Updated `index.md` and `README.md`.

## [2026-07-17] add | Part 8 — Enterprise Work AI and the DSPM Prerequisite (Glean and peers)

Added `wiki/part-8-work-ai-and-dspm.md` on enterprise Work AI platforms (Glean, Copilot/Gemini Enterprise assistant side). Core thesis: these platforms are permission-aware, which is exactly the risk — they faithfully mirror overshared permissions (anyone-with-link, stale ACLs, bloated all-company groups), turning years of quiet oversharing into a natural-language query, so an engineer can surface HR comp / M&A / marketing content they were technically entitled to but never should see. DSPM is the non-optional companion: discover and classify sensitive data, map who-can-access-what, remediate oversharing at the source before connecting the corpus, deliberately map audience-to-content, and run continuously because exposure drifts. References Glean Protect and Microsoft Purview DSPM for AI. Updated `index.md` and `README.md`.

## [2026-07-17] add | Part 9 — Detection, Monitoring, and Incident Response for Agents

Added `wiki/part-9-detection-monitoring-ir.md`, the operational other half of the guide. Core gap: the SIEM sees the action but not the reasoning that drove an autonomous agent. Covers what to log (the causal chain: identity, triggering input, policy, decision, tool+args, output, context), agent behavioral IOCs (credential-read-then-egress, unusual tool sequences, unexpected external connections, token/cost spikes, credential-usage anomalies, prompt-injection signals, memory tampering, out-of-role data access), incident response (fast containment via kill switch + credential revocation + network isolation, and the caution that containment must fail safe, not destructive), agent forensics (preserve prompts/tool-I/O/memory/retrieval/sandbox snapshots tamper-evidently), and the AI-native / context-graph SOC pattern with the reflexive caution that the SOC agent is itself subject to this guide. Vendor concepts folded in without naming vendors. Updated `index.md` and `README.md`.

## [2026-07-17] add | Part 10 — Agent Identity and Non-Human Identity (NHI)

Added `wiki/part-10-agent-identity.md`, the identity spine the guide leaned on. Frames the core question (as whom does the agent act — delegation vs impersonation, with delegation preferred so every action traces to agent-acting-for-user-under-a-grant and can be revoked per-agent), why agent identity breaks human-era IAM (standing-privilege/access sprawl, secrets sprawl, no lifecycle, OAuth/SAML mismatch), and controls: own identity + delegation, ephemeral/task-scoped credentials, just-in-time access with no standing privilege, intent-based validation of actions against declaration, scoped grants, NHI lifecycle governance, killing secrets sprawl, and per-agent revocation. JIT and intent-based access named to Apono (IBAC) per user; NHI stats from CSA / GitGuardian / Verizon DBIR. Cross-links Parts 1/3/6/7/9. Updated `index.md` and `README.md`.
