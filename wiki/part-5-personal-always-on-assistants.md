# Part 5 — Personal, Always-On AI Assistants (OpenClaw / NanoClaw class)

Parts 1-4 covered coding agents. A different class of agent is now spreading faster than any of them: the personal, always-on AI assistant you self-host, which wires an LLM to your files, shell, browser, and — the new part — your messaging apps. OpenClaw is the archetype (open-source, MIT, local-first, roughly 100k GitHub stars in about two days), NanoClaw is the security-forward, container-isolated variant, and a whole guard ecosystem (ClawGuard, ClawKeeper, openclaw-shield, NVIDIA NemoClaw) has grown around them. For a security engineer these carry the same local-execution risk as a coding agent, plus three new ones.

## What Makes This Class Different

- **It acts without being prompted.** These assistants run a heartbeat / scheduler daemon and take actions on a timer or on inbound events, not only when a human types a request. The human-in-the-loop that every control in Parts 1-2 assumed at *trigger time* is gone.
- **Messaging channels are the interface — and the attack surface.** The assistant connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, iMessage, Teams, and more. Anyone who can message it can inject instructions (prompt injection over a DM or a group chat), and those same channels are ready-made exfiltration paths.
- **It is consumer-grade shadow AI.** MIT-licensed, one-command install, local-first. An employee can stand one up on a corp laptop in minutes and wire it to corporate Slack and Gmail — with no security review and no inventory entry.

Two more properties matter:

- **Persistent local memory.** Memory is stored as plain files (often markdown) on the machine. That memory can be poisoned to steer future autonomous runs, and it persists across sessions.
- **Credentials on the device.** By default the assistant holds the API keys and channel tokens it needs. Designs differ sharply here (see below).

## The Core New Risk: Autonomy at Trigger Time

The coding-agent attack path in [Part 1](part-1-risk-surface-and-control-model.md) still applies (untrusted input → credential read → exfil), but here it fires with no human watching:

> A message arrives in a group chat the assistant has joined. It contains a hidden instruction. On its next heartbeat the assistant reads recent messages, follows the instruction, reads a local credential or a private file, and sends it back out over another channel. No one prompted it, and no one saw it happen until the audit log is reviewed — if there is one.

The mitigation is to refuse to treat "scheduled" or "inbound-message-triggered" as equivalent to "user-approved." High-impact actions (shell, credential-path reads, outbound sends of file contents) must still require explicit human approval even on an autonomous run, or be blocked outright on that path.

## Isolation and Credentials: The OpenClaw vs NanoClaw Split

The two archetypes make the tradeoff visible:

- **OpenClaw** — local-first, application-level. Broad reach (files, shell, browser, dozens of channels), memory as markdown on the host, and by default the keys live on the device. Maximum capability, minimum boundary.
- **NanoClaw** — runs each agent group inside its own OS-level container and routes credentials through a vault so agents never hold raw API keys. Same capability, real boundary.

Prefer the NanoClaw shape: container isolation over application-level permission checks, and a credential broker over keys-on-disk (the same broker principle as [Part 3](part-3-architecture-gateways-and-remote-defense.md) and the credential-exclusion goal from [Part 4](part-4-beyond-the-hyperscalers.md)). If you must allow this class of tool, require the container-isolated, vault-backed form, and run it somewhere that does not carry corporate cloud credentials or Kubernetes access.

## The Guard Ecosystem — and a Caution

Because the risk is obvious, a security add-on ecosystem appeared: ClawGuard, ClawKeeper, Knostic's openclaw-shield, and NVIDIA NemoClaw. The common mechanism is familiar from [Part 1](part-1-risk-surface-and-control-model.md): hook the `before_tool_call` event, evaluate the call, and block high-risk actions (secret leaks, PII exposure, destructive commands).

One caution worth stating plainly: several of these guards send the tool call to a **judge LLM** for a verdict. That is more flexible than a rule, but it reintroduces exactly the risk Part 1 warned about — a second model in the decision path is itself promptable and non-deterministic. Prefer deterministic rules for the hard-stops (credential paths, destructive commands, outbound-to-personal-channel), and use an LLM judge only as an additional soft layer, never as the sole gate. And a guard plugin inside the agent is still a *local* layer — the honest limits from the [Part 2](part-2-endpoint-hardening-and-policy-playbook.md) hook example apply here too.

## What a Security Team Should Actually Do

- **Default to unsanctioned on corp assets.** For most organizations, a personal, always-on assistant with shell access and corporate messaging connectors does not belong on a corp-managed laptop or wired to corporate accounts. Put this class on the block side of the agent allowlist from [Part 2](part-2-endpoint-hardening-and-policy-playbook.md), and detect it in discovery — it leaves clear footprints: a long-running Node process, a `~/.openclaw/`-style config and session directory, and new messaging-app integrations.
- **If you allow it, constrain it hard.** Container-isolated per NanoClaw; credentials via a vault, never raw keys on disk; no corporate messaging channels bridged to it; egress allowlisted; and a deterministic hook for the hard-stops.
- **Govern the channels, not just the host.** Decide which messaging platforms may connect at all, and treat every inbound message as untrusted input. A personal WhatsApp bridging a corporate assistant is a data-exfiltration path, not a convenience.
- **Kill unsupervised autonomy on sensitive scopes.** Disable or gate the heartbeat/scheduler so high-impact actions cannot run without a human, and make sure every autonomous action lands in an audit log you actually watch.
- **Watch the memory.** Treat the assistant's persisted memory as attacker-writable; a poisoned memory file steers every future run.

## Bottom Line

Personal always-on assistants take the coding-agent risk surface, remove the human from trigger time, and add messaging channels as both input and exfil. The controls from Parts 1-4 still apply — discovery, deterministic enforcement hooks, credential brokering, isolation, egress control — but they must now hold against an agent that acts on its own schedule and answers to anyone who can send it a message. For most orgs the right default is: not on the corp fleet, and caught by discovery when someone installs it anyway.
